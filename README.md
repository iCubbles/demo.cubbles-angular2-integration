##Run locally
This sample uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the best and fastest way to get an Angular2 application is the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/). 

Just follow this steps, after you install Node.js:

1. 
```
npm install -g angular-cli
```

2.
```
ng new angular2-integration
```

3.
```
ng generate component demo1
ng generate component demo2
ng generate component demo3
```

4.
```
ng generate directive pie-chart
```

...

When you are ready for a visual test just run:
```
ng serve
```

and a Node.js server will be running on port 4200.
