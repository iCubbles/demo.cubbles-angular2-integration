#Cubbles meets Angular2
This repository contains some examples showing Cubbles components used within an Angular2 application.
Find more about the Cubbles Platform at <https://cubbles.github.io>



## Client Side vs. Server Side Rendering
As Angular supports client- and server side rendering we prepared examples for both approaches. 

### Client Side
As this approach does not requires any server side processing - simply klick the follwing link: 
https://rawgit.com/iCubbles/demo.cubbles-angular2-integration/master/client-side/dist/index.html

For details please see [./client-side/README.md](client-side/README.md)

### Server Side 
Running the server side demo requires a local setup.
 
Please check [./server-side/README.md](server-side/README.md) for detailed instructions.
